AquaExplorer is an immersive, interactive tool designed primarily for children to engage with aquatic ecosystems in a digital environment, powered by Leap Motion.

## Features
#### Leap Motion Integration: 
* Offers an intuitive exploration of water bodies and their properties.
#### Contribution to Project Database: 
* Encourages users to add data about local water bodies. Utilizes a Raspberry Pi kit to detect water temperature and environmental humidity, facilitating user contribution via an interactive map.
#### 3D Visualization: 
* Showcases various biotic and abiotic factors crucial to water quality. Notably, it includes a detailed 3D model of the Polybrominated Diphenyl Ether (PBDE) molecule.

## Purpose
The primary goal of AquaExplorer is to provide an educational platform for children, fostering their curiosity about water ecosystems and promoting environmental awareness. By contributing to the project's database, users can gain a sense of community and active participation in the understanding of local water bodies.
